# Environment Setup

This folder contains all files needed to recreate the Python environment for the **EcoInnovators Ideathon 2026 – AI Powered Rooftop PV Detection** project.

## Files
- requirements.txt → List of Python libraries for pip installation.
- environment.yml → Conda environment specification (name: rooftop-ai).
- python_version.txt → Exact Python version used (e.g., 3.10.12).

## Setup Instructions

### Option A: Using pip
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r environment/requirements.txt

### Option B: Using conda
conda env create -f environment/environment.yml
conda activate rooftop-ai

### Verify Installation
Run the following test:
python -c "import numpy, pandas, sklearn, torch, torchvision, cv2, PIL, requests, tqdm; print('Environment OK')"

If you see `Environment OK`, the setup is successful.

## Notes
- Always check python_version.txt to ensure you’re using the correct Python version.
- Update requirements.txt or environment.yml if new libraries are added during development.
- Keep this folder synced so collaborators can reproduce the same environment.
